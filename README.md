## Quickstart: Tiny, Meaningful Contributions

This repository follows a simple “tiny changes” workflow to keep progress visible and consistent:

1. Open a small Issue (e.g., “docs: add TIL note”).
2. Create a short-lived branch per issue.
3. Make a tiny change (README/TIL/config).
4. Commit with a clear message (Conventional Commits).
5. Open a PR that auto-closes the issue (use `Closes #<n>`).
6. Merge PR.

This helps track activity (commits → PRs → issues) and keeps reviews fast.
